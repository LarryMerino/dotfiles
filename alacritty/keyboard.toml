# KEYBOARD

# This section documents the [keyboard] table of the configuration file.
#
# bindings = [{ <key>, <mods>, <mode>, <action> | <chars> },]
#   To unset a default binding, you can use the action "ReceiveChar" to 
#   remove it or "None" to inhibit any action.
#
#   Multiple keybindings can be triggered by a single key press and will 
#   be executed in the order they are defined in.
#
#   key = "<string>"
#
#     The regular keys like "A", "0", and "Ð¯" can be mapped 
#     directly without any special syntax. Full list of named keys 
#     like "F1" and the syntax for dead keys can be found here:
#
#     https://docs.rs/winit/latest/winit/keyboard/enum.NamedKey.html
#     https://docs.rs/winit/latest/winit/keyboard/enum.Key.html#variant.Dead
#
#     Numpad keys are prefixed by Numpad: 
#     "NumpadEnter" | "NumpadAdd" | "NumpadComma" | "NumpadDivide" | "NumpadEquals" | "NumpadSubtract" | "NumpadMultiply" | "Numpad[0-9]".
#
#     The key field also supports using scancodes, which are 
#     specified as a decimal number.
#
#   mods = "Command" | "Control" | "Option" | "Super" | "Shift" | "Alt"
#
# Multiple modifiers can be combined using |, like this: "Control | Shift".
#
# mode = "AppCursor" | "AppKeypad" | "Search" | "Alt" | "Vi"
#
# This defines a terminal mode which must be active for this binding to have an effect.
#
# Prepending ~ to a mode will require the mode to not = be active for the binding to take effect.
#
# Multiple modes can be combined using |, like this: "~Vi|Search".
